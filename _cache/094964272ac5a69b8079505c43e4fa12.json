{"title":"Contesting counter-terrorism: discourse networks and the politicisation of counter-terrorism in Austria - Journal of International Relations and Development","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41268-020-00187-8","image":"https://media.springernature.com/w200/springer-static/cover/journal/41268.jpg","description":"Why do political actors prefer one counter-terrorism policy over another? We apply discourse network analysis and the advocacy coalition framework to the recent debate on counter-terrorism measures in Austria and argue that actorsâ€™ positions are based not so much on objective security factors and international or structural causes but on domestic politics and three interdependent variables. Political actors choose specific counter-terrorism policies because of: (1) a sense of ownership; (2) ideology; and (3) anticipated political gains. We show how different actors in Austria exploit the counter-terrorism debate to shield themselves from being blamed for being passive, to promote their ideological views, and/or to gain politically.","domain":"link.springer.com"}
